# Projects

These are some ideas I've had that interest me. I'll update them periodically, mostly so I have a record.

Some of them have business potential, some are entirely for fun. If anyone ever wanted to co-found something, particularly based on one of these ideas, please get in touch.

(This is empty for now because I wanted to get the site up and running. Will be filled in shortly.)
