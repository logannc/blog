### Motivation

### Setup

I'll almost certainly have to update this later. Hard to describe the setup when it isn't finished yet.

{{
    embed_image(src="https://www.goheroe.org/images/post/6/blog.png",
        height="350px",
        center=true,
        alt="Stolen Graphic from goheroe",
        caption="Replace Hugo with Gutenberg")
}}

The short version is that I'm copying [this guy's setup](https://www.goheroe.org/2017/08/21/host-your-blog-for-free-with-hugo-github-netlify-and-cloudflare/) but substituting [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Gutenberg](https://www.getgutenberg.io) (primarily because I'm a bit of a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) fanboy). I'm using the [Hyde](https://www.getgutenberg.io/themes/hyde/) theme with some necessary modifications because it comes a bit... bare.
